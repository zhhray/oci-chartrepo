# OCI-ChartRepo
OCI [(Open Container Initiative)](https://opencontainers.org/) is an open governance structure for the express purpose of creating open industry standards around container formats and runtimes.

Helm 3 supports OCI for package distribution. Chart packages are able to be stored and shared across OCI-based registries. [Here](https://helm.sh/docs/topics/registries/)

OCI Artifacts actually use an existing docker repository as an infrastructure, extending its capabilities to support other types of artifacts

oci-chartrepo as an adapter that supports the transformation of OCI data structures into standard chart repository data structures.

# How to use
## Helm v3
```sh
  # There is a docker registry run locally on localhost:5000
  $ helm chart save mychart/ localhost:5000/myrepo/mychart:2.7.0

  # Install helm push plugin
  $ helm plugin install https://github.com/chartmuseum/helm-push.git
  $ helm chart push localhost:5000/myrepo/mychart:2.7.0

  # The directory structure of the chart artifacts cache also follows the OCI Image specification, you can see the mediaType in index.json is `application/vnd.oci.image.manifest.v1+json`
```

## Launch arguments
```sh
    --port                          # The server listen port (default is 8080)
    --storage                       # storage backend(only registry and harbor for now)
    --storage-registry-repo         # Your oci registry address (eg. 192.168.0.1:5000 or harbor.example.io)
    --storage-registry-scheme       # Your oci registry address scheme (HTTP or HTTPS), default is empty means that the scheme will be automatically determined. 
                                    # If it is found that --storage-registry-repo is a harbor v2+, it will automatically HTTPS, the value setting is invalid.

    # Try to create Harbor backend first, if it fails, continue to create Registry backend.
```

## APIS
```sh
    /index.yaml     # Get the OCI data from --storage-registry-repo, then transform them into standard chart repository data structures.
    /charts/:name   # Download a chart artifact
```

## Build
```sh
  # Locally bin
  make build

  # Docker
  docker build -t oci-chart-registry .
```

# How to Run
## Run locally
```sh
  docker run -d --restart=always --name oci-chart-registry \
  -p 8088:8080 \
  oci-chart-registry --storage-registry-repo={your_registry_addr} --port=8080

  # If your registry equires user authentication, a file in dockerconfigjson(kubernetes secret type) format needs to be mounted into container /etc/secret/dockerconfigjson
  # In the scenario of docker run, the content of dockerconfigjson in kubernetes secret needs to be base64 decoded, and then stored it into the ~/dockerconfigjson file
  # How to generate dockerconfigjson, please refer to the section "Run in kubernetes"
  docker run -d --restart=always --name oci-chart-registry \
  -p 8088:8080 \
  -v ~/dockerconfigjson:/etc/secret/dockerconfigjson \
  oci-chart-registry --storage-registry-repo={your_registry_addr} --storage-registry-scheme=HTTPS --port=8080
```

## Run in kubernetes
```sh
  # Generate secret config file if you need.
  # The dockerconfigjson content can be generated by the following commandï¼š
  kubectl create secret docker-registry my-registry-secret --docker-server=DOCKER_REGISTRY_SERVER --docker-username=DOCKER_USER --docker-password=DOCKER_PASSWORD --docker-email=DOCKER_EMAIL

  # If there are lots of data in your registry, but just focus on the OCI related data, you can mount the whitelist.conf into the container.
  kubectl apply -f deploy/oci-chart-registry-whitelist-cm.yaml

  # Please modify the --storage-registry-repo and --storage-registry-scheme parameters before apply
  kubectl apply -f deploy/oci-chart-registry-deployment.yaml
```

## WhiteList Example
```sh
  # Support for specifying whitelist for different types of Backend.
  # Backend is Harbor:
  #   "proj1": ["repo1-"] means that will get artifacts from repositories of proj1(Project), the names of these repositories can match the string "repo1-"; 
  #   "proj2": [] means that get artifacts from all repositories of proj2(Project).
  # Backend is Registry:
  # The concept of "project" does not exist in Docker Registry.
  #   "image1": ["tag1", "tag2"] means that get blob(artifact) from image1:tag1 and image1:tag2;
  #   "test/chart-abc": [] means that get blob(artifact) from all tags of the image whose name is specified as the "test/chart-abc" string.
  #
  # Example
  {
      "harbor": {
          "proj1": [
              "repo1-"
          ],
          "proj2": []
      },
      "registry": {
          "image1": [
              "tag1",
              "tag2"
          ],
          "test/chart-abc": [],
      }
  }
```
